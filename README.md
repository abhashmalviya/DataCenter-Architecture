DataCenter-Architecture
Comparison analysis of Data Center Networks
Applications today have evolved from single, multiple servers, to being expansively distributed across racks of servers to dynamic models that span across multiple data centers.
Further with the expansion of users from business managers to complete organizations including the customers having access to these applications across multiple devices, 
the stress on existing network infrastructure has increased causing data centers to reach the tipping point. Moreover in all the conventional data centers control, 
management and data planes reside within the single device making it extremely difficult to configure all the devices in the network individually. 
This demands for highly agile and flexible data centers, which can be scaled and centrally managed effectively making use emerging technologies like SDN, to save cost and resources. 
We propose to study the complexity and feasibility of Data Center Networks expansion scaling them horizontally and vertically. In our proposed method we are creating Fat-tree and multi-tiered data center network 
topologies with more than one aggregate levels and also increasing the number of edge layer switches. The implementation is done on mininet and by making use of the learning switches we centrally manage the network using SDN controllers.
Further we implemented performance tests comparing the efficiency of the topologies at various levels when scaled.
